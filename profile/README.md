# Nukleox

Nukleox is a new breed of operating systems solving the disconnect between computing devices and the modern way of using them. Current operating system paradigms were developped 50 years ago and, while they improved a lot, they are still single device oriented while they should be user oriented, managing multiple devices and enabling efficient collaboration between users and businesses.
